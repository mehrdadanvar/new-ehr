The\n                      EdEHR is not a product per se but a service you are\n                      providing, as you say below. In one instance, a learner,\n                      when she could not choose an option that fit with what the\n                      patient was describing, wrote a note in the comments. It\n                      was a great learning moment and something the group was\n                      going to take back to clinical practice.",
