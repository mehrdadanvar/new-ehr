      "Tammy conceived of the idea of using the EdEHR as a laboratory information system (LIS). She is currently BCIT's med lab simulation coordinator and is faculty in the Medical Laboratory Sciences Program. Tammy brings a depth of clinical laboratory experience from across all of BC's health authorities, and she used this experience to guide the design and development of the laboratory information system (LIS) module in the EdEHR. Tammy integrated the way the different regions processed lab requests into an approach that prepares graduate technologists to be ready to get into the real-life lab and get to work right away with confidence.",
      "The LIS module was introduced to the Hematology lab last year, and within weeks the team of instructors went from new concept to managing classes with almost a 100 students per lab. Everything went really well and now the Urinalysis classes are working in the LIS module."

The opportunity to be a part of EdEHR at this stage of its development, and incorporate it into the curriculum has proven to be valuable on many levels. Faculty and students throughout the partnership are benefiting from its use in the skills lab as well as in the context of simulation. The promise for EdEHR to contribute to student learning is immense."
