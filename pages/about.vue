          <p class="p-4 text-gray-800">
            From its inception the EdEHR has been a collaboration, designed by
            and for educators who seek an educational healthcare record system
            where the needs of the student take priority. As one educator puts
            it the "EdEHR lets the pedagogy drive the tool, rather than the
            other way around"
          </p>
          <p class="p-4 text-gray-800">
            Healthcare educators in British Columbia, Canada, saw the need to
            provide their students with educational electronic health record
            system but could not find anything that was feasible, due to
            extremely high costs as well as inflexible content that was
            unsuitable for their curriculums. The provincial government of
            British Columbia funded the prototype project starting in 2018
            through to 2020. The completion of this initial phase of the project
            saw the EdEHR used in a University of British Columbia

            with great success. Approximately 200 students completed their
            in-class assignment, using the EdEHR, without any prior training and
            without any difficulty.

          <p class="p-4 text-gray-800">
            Thanks to the substantial funding from the Health Sciences program
            at BCIT (British Columbia Institute of Technology) the EdEHR project
            is evolving. Currently, the BSN program is bringing EdEHR into all
            nine terms. Medication administration with barcode scanning, along
            with many other new EHR improvements such as clinical order sets,
            head to toe assessments, SBAR, lab requisitions and reports,
            medication orders, fluid balance, allergies, integumentary care,
            etc., will all be used in class this spring of 2024.

          <p class="p-4 text-gray-800">
            BCIT also designed and funded the Lab Information System (LIS) in
            the EdEHR, and this is currently used by 100's of students every
            term in hematology and urinalysis med lab classes. Work is
            continuing to support chemistry and more.
