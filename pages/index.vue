          intraprofessional teams.

          The EdEHR is an innovative educational electronic health record and
          laboratory information system designed in collaboration with
          healthcare educators.
        </p>
        <p>
          The EdEHR is a fully customizable platform and specifically created
          for interprofessional healthcare programs. Thanks to the collaboration
          with healthcare educators the EdEHR transcends technology training and
          emphasizes pedagogical principles to cultivate healthcare learners who
          will truly excel in their field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the EdEHR in both theory, lab and simulation settings will
          promote your students' digital competency and their ability to
          navigate, interpret, and most importantly, communicate relevant
          patient data to the right members of their healthcare team. This will
          make a tangible difference in patient safety and the quality of care
          the patient receives. It also has a direct impact on operational
          efficiency and healthcare team collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teaching students to tell a meaningful patient narrative, rather than
          just recite data, will make a difference between simply producing a
          passing student and developing a quality healthcare professional who
          brings value to any healthcare setting.
